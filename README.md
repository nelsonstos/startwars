# StarWars Challenge

This project is a serverless API developed with Node.js and TypeScript, focused on managing and retrieving data about Star Wars characters and films. The API leverages AWS services like AWS Lambda and DynamoDB, ensuring optimal scalability and efficient data storage.
The project architecture follows a hexagonal approach (also known as Ports and Adapters Architecture), designed to maintain a clear separation between the business core and external layers.

## Key Features

- **Serverless Architecture**: Utilizes AWS Lambda for executing functions in response to events, allowing for a pay-as-you-go pricing model.
- **Database Integration**: Implements DynamoDB as the NoSQL database, leveraging the Dynamoose ORM for seamless interaction.
- **OpenAPI Documentation**: Provides comprehensive API documentation using OpenAPI (Swagger), ensuring clarity in endpoint usage and data formats.
- **Modular Design**: Adopts a clean architecture with a separation of concerns, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **Docker** (if running DynamoDB locally)
- **Typescript** (Last version)
- **Serverless Framework** (v3)
- **AWS Services** (Lambda, APIGateway, DynamoDB, AIM, SQS and SNS)
- **Dynamoose ORM** (Last Version)
- **Postman** (for testing API requests)

## Disign and Architecture
This project implements a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, following a RESTful architectural style. The system is designed to manage Star Wars characters and films, as well as to register and retrieve clients. Additionally, design patterns such as Singleton and dependency injection have been applied, along with a hexagonal architecture, which contributes to improving the system's modularity, maintainability, and extensibility.

```

### 2. Run DynamoDB Locally (Optional)
If you want to run DynamoDB locally using Docker, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4200:8000 amazon/dynamodb-local

```
### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a .env´ file based on .env.example and configure the following:

```bash
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4200
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=j4sb5n
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=ja0e54
STAGE=dev

DYNAMODB_CLIENTS_TABLE=challengeapp-dev-clients

```

### 4. Running the Application
To start the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## API Endpoints
